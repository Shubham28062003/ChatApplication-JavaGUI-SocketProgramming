# ChatApplication-JavaGUI-SocketProgramming
Socket programming is a fundamental aspect of computer networking that enables communication between different devices over a network. It provides a mechanism for processes on different machines to communicate with each other by establishing connections and exchanging data. Java, with its robust networking capabilities, is widely used for implementing socket programming.

In this blog post, we will delve into the basics of socket programming using a simple yet illustrative example â€“ a chat application. The application consists of two main components: a server and a client. Through this example, we will explore the key concepts of socket programming, including server socket creation, client socket creation, and data exchange between them.
